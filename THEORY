The Agora system is composed of three components on the outer layer.

0010) Registrar

- At first, this will probably be one central server, which can be queried to return a list
  of all registered agoras and their properties.  Eventually, multiple registrars could exist
  in theory, if someone was so inclined as to host their own and add it to the config file.

0020) Servers

- These are the actual Agoras themselves.  Upon creation, they list themselves on the Registrar,
  along with their details including address, name, port, number of users connected out of the
  total capacity, and the type of security used for logging in.

0030) Clients

- Whoever wishes to populate an Agora will need a client object in order to do so.  The Client
  simply communicates with the Server, which may then choose to communicate with the Client.

ANATOMY


0010) Registrar

 - Perhaps the most simple and straightforward.  This socket can be queried to return a list of servers.


0020) Server

 - This will be the most complicated of the three outer layer components.

 0021) Creation

  - After the package is loaded, a function must be called to create an Agora.
      CL-USER> (agora:@new :name "test" :address #(72 197 245 1) :port 9678 :security 'SIMPLE)
      <AGORA-SERVER NIL {10042E7103}>
      CL-USER>
  - This should create an as-yet-dormant Agora object featuring a stream and details to-be-used-later.

 0022) Testing

  - Let's come back to this.

 0023) Registering

  - The Agora needs to be listed on the registrar probably.
      CL-USER> (agora:@local)
      (<AGORA-SERVER NIL {10042E7103}>)
      CL-USER> (agora:@register (car *))
      Attempting connection with primary registrar at #(192 232 210 163)...
      Connection successful...Attempting to register Agora for listing...
      Finished.
      You may now call on the registrar list and/or connect to your own Agora.

 0024) Pushing Agora Server Property Changes while keeping Agora Server alive

  - Come the f'ck back to this as well, right!?


0030) Client

  - Will list more here after beginning work. OK!
